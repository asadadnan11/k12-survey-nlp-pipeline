## 📋 Project Overview

This portfolio project demonstrates the implementation of a sophisticated NLP analysis pipeline that processes synthetic K-12 survey responses from students and teachers. The project showcases how educational technology teams could use similar methodologies to identify learning experience pain points and prioritize product development efforts.

Using realistic synthetic data, this project illustrates the complete workflow from data generation through analysis to stakeholder reporting, demonstrating practical applications of sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and interactive data visualization in an educational technology context.

## 🔬 Mechanism & Methodology

### Technical Approach

**Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic survey responses (~800 entries) that simulate authentic K-12 student and teacher feedback patterns, including common themes such as UI/UX concerns, pacing issues, engagement barriers, and technical problems.

**Text Processing**: Employs industry-standard NLP preprocessing including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal using NLTK libraries.

**Feature Extraction**: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to identify and rank the most significant keywords and phrases that differentiate feedback across different user segments.

**Sentiment Analysis**: Implements VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis to quantify emotional tone and satisfaction levels in survey responses.

**Segmentation Analysis**: Systematically analyzes insights by respondent type (student vs. teacher) and grade level groupings (Elementary, Middle, High School) to identify demographic-specific patterns.

**Visualization & Reporting**: Generates comprehensive interactive dashboards and static visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to communicate findings effectively.
