## Project Context

This **capstone simulation project** demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end NLP analysis pipeline for processing educational survey feedback. The project showcases how business analytics can be applied to identify pain points and prioritize development efforts in educational technology.

**Academic Scope**: Using synthetic data (~800 survey responses), this project illustrates the complete analytical workflow from data generation through insights delivery, demonstrating practical applications of sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and business intelligence reporting.

**Learning Objectives**: 
- Apply advanced analytics to business problems
- Translate technical findings into strategic recommendations  
- Create stakeholder-ready visualizations and dashboards
- Demonstrate proficiency in Python data science ecosystem

## Methodology & Technical Approach

### Data Simulation Framework

**Synthetic Survey Generation**: Created realistic survey responses simulating K-12 student and teacher feedback patterns, including common themes such as UI/UX concerns, pacing issues, engagement barriers, and technical problems.

**Text Processing Pipeline**: Employed standard NLP preprocessing including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal using NLTK libraries.

**Feature Engineering**: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to identify and rank significant keywords that differentiate feedback across user segments.

**Sentiment Quantification**: Implemented VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis to measure emotional tone and satisfaction levels.

**Segmentation Analysis**: Analyzed insights by respondent type (student vs. teacher) and grade level groupings to identify demographic-specific patterns.

**Business Intelligence Reporting**: Generated interactive dashboards and executive summaries using matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly.
